					<p>
						I am a 22 year United States Army Veteran. I have been around the world and back, seen some interesting people and cultures but at the same time I was working and teaching myself how to code.

					<p>
						Yes, I am a self taught programmer who actually decided to go to Full Sail University to get a degree and I got it in 2012 Bachelor of Science in Web Development. I also went back to grab my Masters in Internet Marketing. I love to code, it is my passion. I code all day and dream about it at night.
