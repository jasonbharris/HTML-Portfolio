						<p>I am a 22 year Army Veteran. I have been around the world twice over. While still in the military I began my journey into web development. I started off off with curiosity where I challenged myself to build a website. From that curiousity it brought me to a hobbyist. From there I went to making YouTube videos and creating courses for Udemy. But before all that I also challenged myself to get a Bachelor degree from Full Sail University in web development.<p>
